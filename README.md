# student-list 
This repo is a simple application to list student with a webserver (PHP) and API (Flask)
------------

## Context


*POZOS*  is an IT company located in France and develops software for High School.

The innovation department want to disrupt the existing infrastructure to ensure that

it can be scalable, easily deployed with a maximum of automation.

POZOS wants you to build a **POC** to show how docker can help you and how much this technology is efficient.


Currently, the application is running on a single server with any scalability and any high availability.

When POZOS needs to deploy a new release, every time some goes wrong.

In conclusion, POZOS needs agility on its software farm.

## Infrastructure

Dockerhost OS = CentOS 

## Application


The application "*student_list*", this application is very basic and enables POZOS to show the list of the student with their age.

student_list has two modules:

- the first module is a REST API (with basic authentication needed) who send the desire list of the student based on JSON file
- The second module is a web app written in HTML + PHP who enable end-user to get a list of students

Application source code can be found [here](https://github.com/diranetafen/student-list.git "here")


- docker-compose.yml: to launch the application (API and web app)
- Dockerfile: the file that will be used to build the API image (details will be given)
- student_age.json: contain student name with age on JSON format
- student_age.py: contains the source code of the API in python
- index.php: PHPÂ  page where end-user will be connected to interact with the service to - list students with age. The following line must be changed before running the website container to make ***api_ip_or_name*** and ***port*** fit  deployment
